# ruflet

`ruflet` is the command-line package for creating, running, diagnosing, and
building Ruflet applications.

## Install

```bash
gem install ruflet
```

Create a project and run it:

```bash
ruflet new my_app
cd my_app
bundle install
ruflet run --web
```

Generated projects include `ruflet_core` and `ruflet_server` as application
dependencies. Run Ruflet commands directly inside the generated project.

## Commands

```bash
ruflet new <appname>
ruflet run [scriptname|path] [--web|--desktop] [--port PORT]
ruflet debug [scriptname|path]
ruflet devices
ruflet emulators
ruflet doctor [--fix]
ruflet update [web|desktop|all] [--check] [--force]
ruflet build <apk|android|ios|ipa|aab|web|macos|windows|linux> [--lite|--full|--self]
ruflet install [--device DEVICE_ID]
```

`--lite` creates the compact self-contained build: project Ruby is precompiled
when the matching mruby compiler is available, and the bundled VM starts in
parallel with Flutter. `--self` remains an alias for this profile.
Combining `--self --full` selects the full profile; `--self` does not override
an explicit `--full`.

`--full` packages the locked production bundle from `Gemfile.lock` and selects
a target-specific CRuby runtime. Set `RUFLET_FULL_RUNTIME_PATH`, or
`build.full_runtime_path` in `ruflet.yaml`, to a Flutter package named
`ruby_runtime` with a `ruflet-full-runtime.json` manifest for the target.
Ruflet refuses to substitute the lite mruby engine for a requested full build.

Before Flutter resolves or bundles packages, Ruflet removes extension plugins
that are not selected by the current services/extensions configuration.

`ruflet run --desktop` downloads the Ruflet Explorer prebuild for the host the
first time, reuses its versioned cache afterward, and launches it with the
current backend URL.

Commands that create, diagnose, or build a Flutter client compare the cached
template revision with `AdamMusa/ruflet-template` on GitHub. When `main`
changes, Ruflet downloads the new template and refreshes its managed
`build/client` automatically. If GitHub is unavailable, Ruflet keeps using the
last complete cached template. Use `ruflet doctor --fix` to force a clean
template download.

Desktop and web runs use the completed `prebuild-main` client channel by
default. Ruflet checks the channel at most once every six hours and downloads
a new platform build only after every required prebuild job has finished.
Use `ruflet update --force` for an immediate refresh. Set
`RUFLET_CLIENT_CHANNEL=stable` to stay on versioned release assets,
`RUFLET_CLIENT_UPDATE_INTERVAL=0` to check on every run, or
`RUFLET_CLIENT_AUTO_UPDATE=0` to disable automatic client updates.

Run `ruflet install` without `--device` to choose from a numbered list of
connected devices. Pass `--device DEVICE_ID` to skip the prompt.

Run `ruflet help <command>` for all options.
