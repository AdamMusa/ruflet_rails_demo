    # Render your Rails ERB views as native controls, over the WebSocket. Each
    # screen is a normal Rails route: it runs through routing and its controller
    # — params, before_actions, saving a form, loading records, assigning
    # `@ivars` — then the ERB view is compiled into a native control tree. The
    # dispatch is in-process (a function call, not network HTTP: no socket, no
    # disconnect); links navigate by URL and forms POST back through the
    # controller.
    #

    # `start_url` is a path, because there is no second connection to point at:
    # the client dials one route (the WebSocket) and every screen after that is
    # dispatched in-process. When a host is needed at all — Rails still checks
    # the Host header — it is taken from the connection the client actually
    # made, so a phone on the LAN and a browser on localhost both work without
    # configuring anything. A full URL is still accepted, and then names the
    # host verbatim.
    #
    # A `fetcher:` can be injected for tests.
