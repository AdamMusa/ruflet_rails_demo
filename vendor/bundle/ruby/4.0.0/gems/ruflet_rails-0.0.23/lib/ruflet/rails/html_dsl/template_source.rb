      # The ERB file as the app.
      #
      # A normal Ruflet app is a Ruby file: handlers run in the session, mutate
      # state, and the page diffs and patches over the WebSocket. This puts an
      # ERB file in that slot. Templates under app/views describe the screen,
      # and a tap calls a method on the developer's own controller — directly,
      # in the session — after which the template re-renders and only the
      # changed controls are patched.
      #
      # There is no request: no routing, no middleware, no Rack env, and so no
      # "Started POST … Completed 200 OK" per tap. What that costs is the parts
      # of Rails that only exist because of a request — `session`, `flash`,
      # `cookies` and CSRF. State lives where a Ruflet app keeps it instead: in
      # the controller instance, which is held for the life of the session, so
      # an ordinary `@count` survives from one tap to the next.
